# SoundStitch

[Planning Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u82hdJBSSZGcIiLbKkvarjJCi2LfERA8GS2ZqvWjtKg/edit?usp=sharing)

**Story**
- The use of big music apps such as Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, and others give users the opportunity to create playlists with almost every song imaginable. This is great, but mastering the art of matching songs together with a goal or purpose is not an easy thing to achieve when  you can add as many of the songs you want and are not given feedback on what you’re creating.
SoundStitch works as a tool to better craft your playlists, called “stitches” by being able to provide recommendations  upon your preferences. You’ll be able to “stitch” new songs based on diverse features, such as the desired mood, mixability,  genre, etc.

**Market**
- Young adults often want to create better playlists and find new songs or artists, but this can be challenging due to Spotify not allowing personalization of preferences when creating playlists. This app allows for users to choose what they think is important and see a visual representation of their playlists.  

**Habit** 
- This app can be used weekly, to create “stitches” and the stretch goal would be for the user to listen to in their everyday life using Spotify.

**Scope**
- The initial scope allows the user to craft a “stitch” with songs of their choice, which will be retrieved from the Spotify app. They can provide their preferences to create the perfect “stitch” based on a recommendation algorithm.
